A [Skyline](https://github.com/shadowninja108/Skyline) plugin using [cargo-skyline](https://github.com/jam1garner/cargo-skyline) for adding features to the training mode. It interfaces with a [Tesla](https://github.com/WerWolv/libtesla), a Switch custom overlay, for use as a menu to the features offered in training mode.

Built releases can be found [here](https://github.com/jugeeya/UltimateTrainingModpack/releases/).

#### Save States
At any time in Training Mode, you can press `Grab + Down Taunt` to save the state of training mode. This will save the position, state, and damage of each fighter, which can then be reverted to at any time with `Grab + Up Taunt`. Use this instead of the built-in training mode reset!

#### Hitbox Visualization
Currently, hitboxes and grabboxes are supported. When visualization is active, other move effects are temporarily turned off for easier visualization.


##### Mash Toggles
*Note:* Combine this with the shield toggles to force the CPU to perform options OoS when their shield is damaged!

###### Airdodge
CPUs will mash airdodge on the first frame out of hitstun.

CPUs will also shield quickly if they are hit and remain grounded.

###### Jump
